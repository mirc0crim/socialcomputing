			<h4>About Us</h4>
			<p>We at XYZ provide a social platform where people can improve their accent via tutorials, tests and user ratings. </p>
				
			<p>The recordings made by a user are used further to develop podcasts for the visually impaired. It is our vision to enable access to a variety of online information to the visually impaired in our society. 
			</p>	
				<p>Moreover, we provide you a unique opportunity to learn while you earn! By rating the recordings of fellow users you can earn bonus money. The better recordings are used to generate the listening material. 
				</p>
				<p>We urge you to make the best use of our platform for your benefit and the benefit of the visually impaired. An ideal way to use our platform would be to start by taking the lessons provided.
